## Description
The Emoji Morse converter is a program that behaves like a Morse code receiver, converting text characters into words. However, it switches things up by using emojis instead of dots and dashes. It will only be utilized as a quick educational tool for those who want to learn about encrypting or play around more about Morse code and how it is translated.
