## Description
The Emoji Morse converter is a program that behaves like a Morse code receiver, converting text characters into words. However, it switches things up by using emojis instead of dots and dashes. It will only be utilized as a quick educational tool for those who want to learn about encrypting or play around more about Morse code and how it is translated.
### Extra Files
The following files in this respitory were used in developing this project: The Migae Semibold was the font used in styling the captions and the title when starting the program. There's also an icon of a smilley face, which was used in changing the program icon. 
### OFI: Open for Improvements
As I thought of a few more features that I couldn't get to implement on the program, it can still be improved upon if someone wishes to. A few main features it crucially needs is the wrapping of the text so more letters can be used to convert. Also, the only font that supports emojis that actually managed to worked in my favor is Segoe UI symbols, and there is not a lot of fonts that seems to support emojis as a display.
