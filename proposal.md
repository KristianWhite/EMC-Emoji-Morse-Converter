# EMC: Emoji Morse Converter

## Repository
https://github.com/KristianWhite/EMC-Emoji-Morse-Converter.git

## Description
The Emoji Morse converter is a program that behaves like a Morse code receiver, converting text characters into words. However, it switches things up by using emojis instead of dots and dashes. I will utilize this as a quick educational tool for those who want to learn about encrypting or play around more about Morse code and how it is translated.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Uses characters like the emojis as input
- Feature 2
	- Converts the following inputs into letter characters.
- Feature N 
	- Display the text on a screen after typing the input.

## Challenges
- Research on Morse Code
- Research on how the code is transferred into words
- Provide a function that sends a single character but keeps it

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A screen that displays the conversion of the input of emojis into stylized letter characters

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A program that converts the input of emojis into letter characters

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create a list containing a selection of emojis that match the first letter of an emotion to convert
  2. Create a list containing all the alphabets and special characters

- Week 2
  1. Create and implement a function that converts the emojis to each proper letter or character
  2. Make sure no error is present or that the code is running correctly

- Week N (Final)
  1. Use the pygame plugin to display a screen for the letters to show on
  2. Think of a creative way to displsy the converted text
