## Description
The Emoji Morse converter is a program that behaves like a Morse code receiver, converting text characters into words. However, it switches things up by using emojis instead of dots and dashes. I will utilize this as a quick educational tool for those who want to learn about encrypting or play around more about Morse code and how it is translated.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Uses characters like the emojis as input
- Feature 2
	- Converts the following inputs into letter characters.
- Feature N 
	- Display the text on a screen after typing the input.

## Challenges
- Research on Morse Code
- Research on how the code is transferred into words
- Provide a function that sends a single character but keeps it

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A screen that displays the conversion of the input of emojis into stylized letter characters

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A program that converts the input of emojis into letter characters
